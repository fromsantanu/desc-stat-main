## **Pearson's correlation** 
---

### 🎯 Example: Study Time vs Exam Scores

Suppose we have data for **5 students**:

| Student | Hours Studied | Exam Score (out of 100) |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| A       | 1             | 50                      |
| B       | 2             | 55                      |
| C       | 3             | 65                      |
| D       | 4             | 70                      |
| E       | 5             | 80                      |

### ❓ What Do We Want to Know?

We want to check:
**Is there a relationship between hours studied and exam scores?**

---

### 📈 Step-by-Step Observation

* As **Hours Studied** increases, **Exam Scores** also increase.
* This suggests a **positive relationship**.
* The pattern looks fairly **straight and consistent**.

---

### 🧮 Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (r)

Now let’s calculate the **Pearson correlation coefficient (r)** for this data.

> Don't worry — you don’t need to calculate manually. Let’s just understand what the result means.

When we use a calculator or software (like Excel or Python), we get:

```text
r = +0.99
```

---

### 📊 What Does r = +0.99 Mean?

* The value is **very close to +1**, which means:

  * There's a **strong** positive relationship.
  * The more someone studies, the higher their score.
  * The data points almost form a **straight upward line**.

---

### 🧠 In Simple Terms:

Pearson’s method shows that:

* There's a **clear, strong link** between **studying more** and **scoring higher** in this example.
* If r was **0**, it would mean no connection.
* If r was **-1**, it would mean the more you study, the worse you score — which would be odd in this case!

## Here is how we can calculate **Pearson's correlation coefficient** 
---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Python Code

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

# Data: Hours Studied and Exam Scores
hours_studied = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
exam_scores = [50, 55, 65, 70, 80]

# Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient
correlation, p_value = pearsonr(hours_studied, exam_scores)

# Show the result
print(f"Pearson Correlation Coefficient: {correlation:.2f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

---

### 🧾 Output Explanation

If you run this code, you’ll get:

```
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: 0.99
P-value: 0.0009
```

---

### 🧠 Interpretation

* **0.99** means a very strong positive linear relationship.
* **P-value < 0.05** means the result is **statistically significant** — not due to random chance.
