## **Pearson's correlation coefficient** 
---

### âœ… Step-by-Step Python Code

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

# Data: Hours Studied and Exam Scores
hours_studied = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
exam_scores = [50, 55, 65, 70, 80]

# Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient
correlation, p_value = pearsonr(hours_studied, exam_scores)

# Show the result
print(f"Pearson Correlation Coefficient: {correlation:.2f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

### ðŸ§¾ Output Explanation

If you run this code, youâ€™ll get:

```
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: 0.99
P-value: 0.0009
```

---

### ðŸ§  Interpretation

* **0.99** means a very strong positive linear relationship.
* **P-value < 0.05** means the result is **statistically significant** â€” not due to random chance.
