## 🧠 **Cramér’s V Correlation Explained in Simple Terms**

**Cramér’s V** is a statistic used to measure the **association between two categorical variables**. It is based on the chi-square statistic and gives a value between:

* **0 (no association)**
* **1 (perfect association)**

Unlike chi-square which tells you **whether** two variables are related, **Cramér’s V** tells you **how strongly** they are related.

---

### 📌 **When to Use Cramér’s V?**

* You have **two categorical variables** (like gender and product preference).
* You want to **measure the strength of association**, not just test for independence.

---

### 📐 **Formula of Cramér’s V**

$$
V = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n \cdot (k - 1)}}
$$

Where:

* $\chi^2$ = Chi-square statistic
* $n$ = total number of observations
* $k$ = min(number of rows, number of columns)

---

### ✅ **Python Example**

Let’s compute Cramér’s V between two categorical variables using a small dataset.

#### 👨‍💻 Example: Gender vs Preferred Drink

---

### 📋 **Data Set**

This is a **contingency table** showing the **preference for different drinks** across **genders**:

|        | Coffee | Tea | Juice |
| ------ | ------ | --- | ----- |
| Male   | 20     | 30  | 10    |
| Female | 10     | 40  | 20    |

---

### 🧾 **Interpretation**

* **Rows (`index`)**: Categories of the first variable → Gender (`Male`, `Female`)
* **Columns**: Categories of the second variable → Drink preference (`Coffee`, `Tea`, `Juice`)
* **Cell values**: Number of people in that combination
  e.g.,

  * 20 males prefer coffee
  * 40 females prefer tea
  * 10 males prefer juice

This is the kind of categorical data we use to compute **Cramér’s V**, to see if there's a statistical relationship between **gender** and **drink preference**.

Let's visualize the drink preferences by gender using a **grouped bar chart** — it's perfect for showing categorical comparisons.

Here’s the Python code to generate the plot using **Matplotlib** and **Pandas**:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Coffee': [20, 10],
    'Tea': [30, 40],
    'Juice': [10, 20]
}, index=['Male', 'Female'])

# Plot grouped bar chart
data.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(8, 5))
plt.title('Drink Preference by Gender')
plt.xlabel('Gender')
plt.ylabel('Number of People')
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.legend(title='Drink')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 📊 **What the Plot Shows**

* Each **group** of bars represents a gender.
* Each **color** corresponds to a type of drink.
* You can clearly compare preferences **within and between** genders.




```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

def cramers_v(confusion_matrix):
    chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(confusion_matrix)
    n = confusion_matrix.sum().sum()
    min_dim = min(confusion_matrix.shape) - 1
    return np.sqrt(chi2 / (n * min_dim))

# Sample data as a contingency table
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Coffee': [20, 10],
    'Tea': [30, 40],
    'Juice': [10, 20]
}, index=['Male', 'Female'])

# Compute Cramér’s V
v = cramers_v(data)
print(f"Cramér's V: {v:.4f}")
```

---

### 🔍 **Interpreting the Output**

Suppose you get:

```
Cramér's V: 0.2443
```

* This means there’s a **weak to moderate** association between **gender** and **preferred drink**.
* Closer to **1** means stronger relationship.

---

### 🧩 Bonus Tip: Use When...

* Your variables are both **nominal** (unordered).
* You want a **symmetric measure** of association.
