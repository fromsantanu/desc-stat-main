### 📏 Standardization in Statistics: Explained Simply

**Standardization** (also known as **z-score normalization**) is a method used in statistics to **rescale** data so that it has a **mean of 0** and a **standard deviation of 1**.

---

### 🎯 Why Do We Standardize?

Standardization is used when:

* You want to **compare variables** measured on **different scales** (e.g., height in cm vs. weight in kg).
* You're preparing data for **machine learning models** that are sensitive to scale (e.g., SVM, k-NN, logistic regression).
* You want to **detect outliers**, as standardized values (z-scores) show how far a value is from the mean.

### 🧮 How Is It Done?

For each value $x$ in a dataset:

$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

Where:

* $x$ = original value
* $\mu$ = mean of the dataset
* $\sigma$ = standard deviation of the dataset
* $z$ = standardized value (z-score)

---

### 📦 Example

Suppose we have a dataset of exam scores:

```python
scores = [60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
```

1. Mean $\mu$ = 80
2. Standard deviation $\sigma$ ≈ 15.81
3. Standardized value for 90:

$$
z = \frac{90 - 80}{15.81} ≈ 0.63
$$

It means 90 is **0.63 standard deviations** above the mean.

### 📊 Interpretation of Z-Scores

| Z-Score      | Interpretation      |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 0            | Exactly the mean    |
| +1           | 1 SD above the mean |
| -1           | 1 SD below the mean |
| > +2 or < -2 | Potential outlier   |

---

### 🛠 In Python

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

data = np.array([[60], [70], [80], [90], [100]])
scaler = StandardScaler()
standardized_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

print(standardized_data)

```

---

### ✅ Summary

* **Standardization** puts data on a common scale.
* It’s helpful for **comparison**, **machine learning**, and **detecting outliers**.
* Always check if the **mean and standard deviation** assumptions make sense for your data before applying it.

### Let's walk through a **case study** with **visualization** to see how standardization works in practice.

## 📊 Case Study: Standardizing Student Scores

### 🎓 Scenario

A school tracks students’ scores in two subjects:

* **Math (out of 100)**
* **Science (out of 50)**

We want to:

1. Compare performance **fairly** across subjects.
2. Prepare the data for analysis or machine learning.
3. Visualize the effect of standardization.


### 🧮 Step 1: Create the Dataset

```

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Original scores
data = {
    'Math': [90, 85, 78, 92, 88, 76, 95, 89, 84, 91],
    'Science': [45, 40, 35, 48, 44, 38, 47, 43, 41, 46]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

```
### 📈 Step 2: Visualize Original Scores

```
df.plot(kind='bar', title='Original Scores (Different Scales)', figsize=(10, 5))
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

### 🔄 Step 3: Standardize the Data

```
scaler = StandardScaler()
standardized = scaler.fit_transform(df)
df_standardized = pd.DataFrame(standardized, columns=['Math_z', 'Science_z'])

```
### 📉 Step 4: Visualize Standardized Scores

```
df_standardized.plot(kind='bar', title='Standardized Scores (Z-Scores)', figsize=(10, 5))
plt.axhline(y=0, color='gray', linestyle='--')
plt.ylabel('Z-Score')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

### 📌 Interpretation

* In the original plot, **Math scores appear much higher** than Science, but that’s just due to different scales (100 vs 50).
* After standardization:

  * All scores are now **centered around 0**.
  * A z-score of **+1** means the student scored 1 standard deviation above the mean.
  * This lets us **fairly compare** performance across subjects.
