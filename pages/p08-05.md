## 🧠 **Phi Correlation Coefficient Explained**

The **Phi Correlation Coefficient** (𝜙) is a measure of the strength of association between **two binary variables** (i.e., variables with only 2 possible values like Yes/No, 0/1, True/False).

---

### 📌 When to Use Phi Coefficient?

Use it when both variables are:

* **Categorical** and
* **Binary** (each has exactly **two categories**)

Example:

* Smoking: Yes / No
* Lung Disease: Yes / No

---

### 🧮 How It's Calculated?

You create a **2x2 contingency table** like this:

|       | Y = 1 | Y = 0 |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| X = 1 | a     | b     |
| X = 0 | c     | d     |

Then, Phi coefficient is:

$$
\phi = \frac{ad - bc}{\sqrt{(a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d)}}
$$

### 🐍 Python Example

Let's calculate Phi coefficient for a simple case.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import matthews_corrcoef

# Binary data: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
# Example: Whether a person smokes and whether they have lung disease
# X = Smoking (1=Yes, 0=No)
# Y = Lung Disease (1=Yes, 0=No)

X = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  # Smoking
Y = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  # Lung Disease

# Calculate Phi Coefficient
phi_coefficient = matthews_corrcoef(X, Y)

print(f"Phi Correlation Coefficient: {phi_coefficient:.2f}")
```

---

### ✅ Output:

If you run the above code, it will print something like:

```
Phi Correlation Coefficient: 0.77
```

That means there’s a **strong positive correlation** between smoking and lung disease in this dataset.

### 🔍 Interpretation

* **+1** → perfect positive association
* **-1** → perfect negative association
* **0** → no association
