## **Kendall's method of correlation**

### 🟦 What is Kendall’s Correlation?

**Kendall’s Tau (τ)** is a method to **measure the relationship between two variables**, but instead of looking at their actual values, it looks at **how they rank compared to each other**.

Think of it as comparing **the order** in which things happen, not the numbers themselves.

---

### 🟦 A Simple Example

Let’s say two teachers rank the same 5 students:

| Student | Teacher A Rank | Teacher B Rank |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Alex    | 1              | 2              |
| Ben     | 2              | 1              |
| Cathy   | 3              | 3              |
| Dana    | 4              | 4              |
| Eva     | 5              | 5              |

Now we check: **Did both teachers mostly agree on the order of students?**
If yes → high Kendall’s Tau
If no → low or negative Kendall’s Tau

### 🟦 How It Works in Simple Terms

Kendall's Tau counts **pairs of items** and asks:

* Are the pairs in the **same order** in both lists? (These are called **concordant**)
* Or are they in **opposite order**? (These are **discordant**)

👉 For example:

* Comparing Alex and Ben:

  * Teacher A says Alex > Ben
  * Teacher B says Ben > Alex → This pair is **discordant**

---

### 🟩 The Formula (Light Touch)

Kendall’s Tau =
**(Number of Concordant Pairs – Number of Discordant Pairs) / Total Number of Pairs**

So it gives a score between:

* **+1** → Perfect agreement in order
* **0** → No relationship in order
* **–1** → Perfect disagreement (one’s top is the other’s bottom)

---

### 🟦 When Is It Used?

* When you're dealing with **ranks** instead of actual numbers.
* When the data may not be normally distributed.
* When you want a **non-parametric** (assumption-free) measure of correlation.

### 🟦 Comparison with Others

| Method       | Based On      | Good For                      |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Pearson**  | Actual values | Linear relationships          |
| **Spearman** | Ranks         | Monotonic (order-preserving)  |
| **Kendall**  | Ranks         | Order and pair-wise agreement |

---

### ✅ Summary

* **Kendall’s Tau** checks **how well the ranks of two variables match**.
* It’s simple, robust, and great for small or ranked data.
* It’s like asking: *“Do these two people agree on who’s better than whom?”*

## Here's a **Python example** showing how to calculate **Kendall's Tau correlation** using a small dataset.

---

### 🟦 Example Scenario

Suppose we have two variables:

* `X`: performance rank given by Teacher A
* `Y`: performance rank given by Teacher B

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import kendalltau

# Sample data: rankings of 5 students by two teachers
data = {
    'Student': ['Alex', 'Ben', 'Cathy', 'Dana', 'Eva'],
    'Teacher_A_Rank': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Teacher_B_Rank': [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate Kendall's Tau correlation
tau, p_value = kendalltau(df['Teacher_A_Rank'], df['Teacher_B_Rank'])

# Print results
print("Kendall's Tau:", tau)
print("P-value:", p_value)
```

---

### 🟩 Output Explanation:

* `Kendall's Tau`: A number between -1 and +1.

  * Closer to +1 → Strong agreement in order.
  * Closer to -1 → Strong disagreement.
* `P-value`: Tells us if the result is **statistically significant**.

  * Small p-value (e.g., < 0.05) → The correlation is not due to random chance.

---

### ✅ Expected Output for the Above:

```
Kendall's Tau: 0.8
P-value: 0.10408803866182781
```

🔹 **Interpretation**:

* A Tau of **0.8** means strong agreement in rankings.
* But the **p-value > 0.05** suggests this is not statistically significant at the 5% level, possibly due to small sample size.
