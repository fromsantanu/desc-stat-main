## üåê **What is Correlation?**

**Correlation** is a statistical measure that describes the **strength** and **direction** of a relationship between two variables.

* It answers the question:
  üëâ *"When one variable changes, does the other tend to change too? And if so, how?"*

## üìä **Types of Correlation**

| Type                     | Description                                          | Example                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Positive Correlation** | As one variable increases, the other also increases. | Height vs. Weight          |
| **Negative Correlation** | As one variable increases, the other decreases.      | Exercise time vs. Body fat |
| **Zero Correlation**     | No clear relationship between the variables.         | Shoe size vs. Intelligence |

---
## üî¢ **How is Correlation Measured?**

We use the **correlation coefficient**, often represented as **`r`**, which ranges between:

* `+1` ‚Üí **Perfect Positive Correlation**
* `0` ‚Üí **No Correlation**
* `-1` ‚Üí **Perfect Negative Correlation**

| Value of `r` | Interpretation       |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| 0.9 to 1.0   | Very strong positive |
| 0.7 to 0.9   | Strong positive      |
| 0.4 to 0.7   | Moderate positive    |
| 0.0 to 0.4   | Weak to no positive  |
| -0.4 to 0.0  | Weak to no negative  |
| -0.7 to -0.4 | Moderate negative    |
| -0.9 to -0.7 | Strong negative      |
| -1.0 to -0.9 | Very strong negative |

## üìå **Important Points**

1. **Correlation ‚â† Causation**
   Just because two things are correlated doesn‚Äôt mean one causes the other.

   > *Example: Ice cream sales and drowning cases both increase in summer ‚Äî but one doesn‚Äôt cause the other.*

2. **Correlation works best with linear relationships.**
   Non-linear patterns may not be well represented.

3. **Outliers** can strongly affect correlation.

## üßÆ Example in Python

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Example data
height = [150, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180]
weight = [50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75]

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'Height': height, 'Weight': weight})

# Calculate correlation
correlation = df.corr()
print(correlation)

```
## üåê Plotting Correlation

## üìå 1. **Scatter Plot (Pairwise Visualization)**

A **scatter plot** shows the relationship between two variables. Each point represents one observation.

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Best for **understanding pairwise relationships** (e.g., Height vs. Weight).
* Visually shows **trend** and **strength** of correlation.

### üîß Python Example:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
height = [150, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180]
weight = [50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75]

# Create scatter plot
plt.scatter(height, weight, label='Data Points')

# Fit a linear trend line (1st-degree polynomial)
slope, intercept = np.polyfit(height, weight, 1)
trend_line = [slope * x + intercept for x in height]

# Plot the trend line
plt.plot(height, trend_line, color='red', label='Trend Line')

# Titles and labels
plt.title('Scatter Plot with Trend Line: Height vs Weight')
plt.xlabel('Height (cm)')
plt.ylabel('Weight (kg)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()

```
### üìà What You'll See:

* A straight upward trend of dots shows **positive correlation**.

---

## üìå 2. **Correlation Matrix (Multi-variable Overview)**

A **correlation matrix** shows pairwise correlations between **multiple variables** in a tabular format.

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Best for **datasets with many numeric variables**.
* Helps to **quickly find strongly related features**.

### üîß Python Example using `seaborn`:
```

import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Height': [150, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180],
    'Weight': [50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75],
    'Age':    [20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Compute correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df.corr()

# Plot heatmap
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

```
### üìà What You'll See:

* A color-coded matrix with values between `-1` and `+1`
* Strong correlations (like height and weight) show values close to `1`
* Unrelated variables (like age and height in this case) may show weaker correlations

## Case Study : correlation heatmap generated from a simulated Health Dataset

---

```

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulate data
np.random.seed(0)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Age': np.random.randint(20, 70, 100),
    'BMI': np.random.normal(25, 4, 100),
    'BloodPressure': np.random.normal(120, 15, 100),
    'Cholesterol': np.random.normal(200, 30, 100),
    'Glucose': np.random.normal(100, 20, 100),
    'ExercisePerWeek': np.random.randint(0, 7, 100)
})

# Show data
display(data.head())

# Correlation matrix
corr = data.corr()

# Heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix - Health Metrics')
plt.show()

```
You will see a correlation heatmap generated from a simulated **Health Dataset** with 100 individuals. The dataset includes the following variables:

* **Age**
* **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
* **Blood Pressure**
* **Cholesterol**
* **Glucose**
* **Exercise per Week**

### üîç Key Observations from the Heatmap:

* **BMI and Blood Pressure** show a mild positive correlation.
* **Glucose** has slight inverse relationships with **Exercise Per Week**.
* **Cholesterol and Blood Pressure** show a mild correlation.
* Most values are in the range of **-0.3 to 0.3**, indicating **weak to moderate correlations**, which is common in real-life health data.

You can explore the full dataset above. Let me know if you'd like to:

* Perform more advanced statistical tests (like regression)
* Filter or group the data
* Visualize specific pair plots or distributions
