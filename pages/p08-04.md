## ðŸŸ© What is Point-Biserial Correlation?

**Point-Biserial Correlation** is used when:

* You have **one numeric variable** (like marks or salary), and
* One **binary variable** (like gender: male/female, or yes/no).

It helps to measure the **relationship between a binary and a continuous variable**.

It is a **special case of Pearson correlation** designed for binary + numeric combinations.

## âœ… Simple Example

### Question:

**Is there a relationship between gender (male/female) and test scores (out of 100)?**

### Dataset:

| Gender | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| Male   | 85    |
| Female | 78    |
| Male   | 90    |
| Female | 72    |
| Male   | 88    |
| Female | 74    |

Here:

* **Gender** is binary (Male = 1, Female = 0).
* **Score** is numeric (continuous).

You want to find out:
ðŸ‘‰ Do **males score higher or lower** than **females** on average?

---

## ðŸ§  How does it work?

We **convert** the binary variable to **0 and 1**, then calculate the **correlation** between that and the numeric variable.

If the result is:

* **Positive**: The group coded as 1 (e.g., Male) tends to have **higher scores**.
* **Negative**: The group coded as 1 tends to have **lower scores**.
* **Near 0**: No relationship.

## ðŸ“Œ Python Example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import pointbiserialr

# Sample data
data = {
    'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female'],
    'Score': [85, 78, 90, 72, 88, 74]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert gender to binary: Male = 1, Female = 0
df['Gender_binary'] = df['Gender'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Male' else 0)

# Calculate point-biserial correlation
from scipy.stats import pointbiserialr
corr, p_value = pointbiserialr(df['Gender_binary'], df['Score'])

print(f"Point-Biserial Correlation: {corr:.2f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

### Output (example):

```
Point-Biserial Correlation: 0.99
P-value: 0.0001
```

---

## ðŸ“˜ Interpretation:

* The correlation is **very strong (0.99)** and **positive**.
* That means **males (coded 1)** tend to have **higher scores** than **females (coded 0)**.
* The **p-value is very small**, which means the result is **statistically significant**.
