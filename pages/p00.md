## ‚úÖ What is Descriptive Statistics?

**Descriptive Statistics** refers to the **summary and organization of data** in a meaningful way. It helps you understand the **basic features** of a dataset using numerical and graphical methods.

It **does not make predictions or inferences**, but it gives you a **snapshot** of what your data looks like.

## üîç Key Components of Descriptive Statistics

| Category                  | Measures                                               | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Central Tendency**      | - Mean<br>- Median<br>- Mode                           | Where is the center of the data?            |
| **Dispersion**            | - Range<br>- Variance<br>- Standard Deviation<br>- IQR | How spread out is the data?                 |
| **Shape of Distribution** | - Skewness<br>- Kurtosis                               | Is the data symmetric? Are there outliers?  |
| **Position**              | - Percentiles<br>- Quartiles                           | Where does a value lie in the distribution? |

## üìä Tools Used in Descriptive Statistics

* **Tables**: Frequency table, cross-tabulations
* **Charts**: Bar charts, histograms, pie charts, box plots
* **Numerical Measures**: Summary statistics (e.g., mean, median)

## üß† Application in Data Analysis

### 1. **Understanding the Data**

Before any analysis or modeling, descriptive stats help you:

* Understand the distribution
* Detect outliers
* Identify errors or anomalies
* Check assumptions for further analysis

### 2. **Data Cleaning**

* Summary statistics help identify missing or extreme values
* Helps determine data transformation needs (e.g., normalization)

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* First step in data science
* Descriptive statistics give initial insights into:

  * Data patterns
  * Correlations
  * Group-wise behavior

### 4. **Comparing Groups**

* Use mean and standard deviation to compare variables across groups
* Box plots and grouped summaries help in visual comparison

### 5. **Report Generation**

* For non-technical stakeholders, descriptive stats offer understandable summaries
* Useful in dashboards and automated reporting

## üìå Example

Suppose you have exam scores of 100 students.

* **Mean** = 75 ‚Üí Average score
* **Median** = 78 ‚Üí Half the students scored below 78
* **Standard Deviation** = 10 ‚Üí Most scores lie between 65 and 85
* **Histogram** ‚Üí Visualizes how scores are distributed

This helps identify how students performed overall and whether there are extreme scores that need attention.

| Aspect                      | Role of Descriptive Statistics               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Simplify data               | By using numerical summaries                 |
| Visualize data              | Using plots like histograms, box plots       |
| Prepare for deeper analysis | As a prerequisite for inferential statistics |
| Communicate findings        | Easily interpretable insights                |
